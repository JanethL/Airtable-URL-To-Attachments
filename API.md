# API Documentation

This documentation is primarily meant for **Connector APIs**, it will appear
above endpoint API documentation in the API Standard Library

Usage examples and additional information around calling this API belong here.
Note that Connector APIs show up in autocomplete, so endpoint descriptions are
most important. You can change them by modifiying the comments above your
exported function code.
